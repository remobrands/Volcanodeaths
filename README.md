# Volcano-deaths
Remo Brands, 6052576

This project predicts the amount of deaths caused by volcano eruptions until the year 2050, using Python. Everyone can run the code and all functions have been documented properly, so that these functions can be used for slightly different data sets as well. The data that has been used, is a list of all eruptions that led to certain deaths in the last few centuries, including the amount of deaths of each eruption. By using this data, a trend has been recognised, after which an educated guess regarding the upcoming decennia has been made. The following hypothesis had been made: 'Because of improved education and hazard management, the amount of deaths have dropped drastically in the last few centuries. Perhaps the function will follow a negative logarithmic trend, or an exponential one. The amount of deaths up until the year 2050 are predicted to be a few hundred.'

For this project the following algorithms have been used:
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing.
- Matplotlib for visualisation.
- SciPy for testing and curve fitting.

# Volcanodeaths
Remo Brands, 6052576

The idea of the project is to predict the amount of deaths caused by volcano eruptions in the upcoming ten yeaers, using Python. Everyone should be able to run the source code and the code should be well-documented, tested and packaged. The data that is going to be used, is a list of all eruptions that led to certain deaths in the last few centuries, including the amount of deaths of each eruption. By using this data, a trend might be recognised, which can give an educated guess regarding the upcoming ten years. My hypothesis is that because of improved education and hazard management, the amount of deaths have dropped drastically in the last few centuries. Perhaps it will look like a negative logarithmic function. I expect the amount of deaths in the next ten years to be a few hundred.

For this project I will likely need to use at least the following algorithms:
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing.
- Matplotlib for visualisation.
- SciPy for testing and curve fitting.
